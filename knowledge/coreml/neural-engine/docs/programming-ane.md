# Can I program the ANE directly?

Unfortunately not. You can only use the Neural Engine through Core ML at the moment.

There currently is no public framework for programming the ANE. There are several private, undocumented frameworks but obviously we cannot use them as Apple rejects apps that use private frameworks. 

(Perhaps in the future Apple will provide a public version of [AppleNeuralEngine.framework](https://github.com/nst/iOS-Runtime-Headers/tree/master/PrivateFrameworks/AppleNeuralEngine.framework).)
