## Recent devices without a Neural Engine

It's important to note that not *all* new devices have a Neural Engine. The A10 and earlier chipsets do not have an ANE, but are still present in certain devices released recently by Apple.

Devices with an A10 Fusion:

- iPhone 7, 7 Plus (2016)
- iPad (6th gen, 2018)
- iPad (7th gen, 2019)
- iPod touch (7th gen, 2019)

Devices with an A10X Fusion:

- iPad Pro 10.5-inch (2017)
- iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2nd gen, 2017)
- Apple TV 4K (1st gen, 2017)

Devices older than 2016 (using A10 Fusion or earlier chipsets) obviously do not have a Neural Engine.

The Apple Watch Series 3 (2017) and earlier, do not have an ANE.

Intel-based Macs do not have an ANE.
